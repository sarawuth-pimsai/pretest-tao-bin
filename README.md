# Question
### create an application using react that:
- uses the github api https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-all-public-repositories to list all public repositories
- shows 10 repositories per page in a table with the information you can choose to show
- has pagination to allow the user to see 10 repos per page

> bonus points if:
> it looks great
>
> - you donâ€™t use any UI libraries
> - the user can navigate to any page (not just going next and back)
> - demonstrates use of react hooks such as useEffect, useEtate, useContext or useRef.
> - use git, write clean commits, and targeted tests
